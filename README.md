# Homework 2 - Getting to know Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is the design tool of choice for CMSC 475, and for many other companies, too!

Through this ENTIRE semester we'll be relying on FIGMA to help us prepare documentation, wire frames, working prototypes, and other design documents.

By the end of the semester, use of FIGMA should be second nature to you. You should be comfortable jumping right in and incorporating FIGMA into your others classes and projects - just like you would open up google docs or google sheets!

## Project description

For this assignment, you are to apply FIGMA to your resume, creating a prettified version. You will be submitting a PDF of the prettified version.

Here are a few links to the FIGMA documentation. One of the key learning objectives of this assignment is to get comfortable with the FIGMA website and the materials their tutorials and learning materials.

## Key links

- [Figma "design your resume" exercise](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/cv/) - this page was the genesis for this homework assignment.

- [Figma short and sweet lessons in design](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/lessons/) - this page offers lots of places to start. NO - you don't need to walk through every one of these. I would suggest that you review these four:

    - [Getting started](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/getting-started/) - focused on learning design in general, NOT on how to use Figma.
    - [Design thinking and ethics](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/ethics/)
    - [Hierarchy](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/hierarchy/) - organizing and presenting elements in a ways to suggest importance.
    - [Typography](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/typography/) - typeface selection, color contrast, align, readability and more.

## Deliverables

- Clone this template using GIT from a terminal command line. YES - it's harder tham using the web or hub version, but get over it! You'll need to do it for later assignments, so you might as well learn now.  **ASK QUESTIONS!**

        cd ~
        mkdir projects
        cd projects

    or

        cd ~/projects

    Then 

        git clone git@github.com:cmsc-vcu/cmsc475-202320-hw2-<your EID goes here>.git
        cd cmsc475-202320-hw2-<your EID goes here>

- Export PDF of your resume from Figma into into the local project repo folder on your hard drive.

- add, commit and push the changes to GITHUB.com USING the command line tool:

        git add -A
        git commit -a -m "a little description of what I just did"
        git push

- Submit your GITHUB repo to [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/488530)
